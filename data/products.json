        "summary":"The iPhone 12 costs more than its predecessors but has a crisp new HDR OLED screen. It offers nearly all the feaures of the iPhone 12 Pro, minus some camera capabilities, but should be a good enough package for most users. Apple has returned to a flat aluminium frame but the iPhone 12 promises to be more durable thanks to its Ceramic Shield material on the front and IP68 rating. You get the A14 Bionic SoC which makes everyday use extremely smooth and responsive, but the device does get a bit warm when stressed. Battery life is good, but not great, and you'll be able to get through a full day. The iPhone 12 is relatively light and easy to handle. iOS 14 has some new customisation options and privacy features. You get two rear cameras - a wide-angle and an ultra-wide-angle one, which both have 12-megapixel sensors. Night mode now works across all cameras including the front one, and still shots as well as videos are remarkably sharp and detailed in the daytime as well as at night.",

It was first announced in July 2013 as a budget smartphone line,[1] and became a separate sub-brand of Xiaomi in 2019 with entry-level and mid-range devices, while Xiaomi itself produces upper-range and flagship Mi phones. Redmi phones use the Xiaomi's MIUI user interface on top of Android. Models are divided into the entry-level Redmi, the mid-range Redmi Note, and the high-end Redmi K. In addition, the unrelated Mi A Android One series is also positioned in the similar market segment with Redmi devices, despite being part of the upper-range Xiaomi Mi lineup. The most significant difference from other Xiaomi smartphones is that they use less-expensive components and thus have lower prices while retaining higher specifications. In August 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that in the second quarter of the 2014 fiscal year, Xiaomi had a market share of 4% of smartphone shipment rankings in China.[2] Redmi sales were attributed as a contributing factor toward this gain in shipment rankings.",

        "summary":"The OnePlus 8 Pro has a similar design as the OnePlus 8 but with some subtle changes. Its display is actually rounded on the sides, rather than just having curved glass like on the 8. It has a pretty big 6.78-inch QHD+ (1440x3168-pixel) AMOLED panel, with a claimed high colour accuracy and HDR10+ support. New this year is the 120Hz refresh rate. The display is vibrant, colourful, and bright. The software experience is very similar to that of the OnPlus 8, with the exception of controls for some additions such as reverse wireless charging and video playback enhancement. The interface feels snappy, and OxygenOS in general runs very well. App and gaming performance is pretty solid. The stereo speakers sound great and the Dolby Atmos setting helps improve quality and spatial separation. The rear cameras get a big upgrade. The main 48-megapixel camera captures very good details nd colours under most lighting conditions. The wide-angle camera also shoots grat pictures and can even do extreme close-up photography. The telephoto camera is good too, and nearly on par with the Samsung Galaxy S20+ in terms of quality. Battery life is excellent but the big addtion here, is wireless charging. The 8 Pro also supports reverse wireless charging. ",
